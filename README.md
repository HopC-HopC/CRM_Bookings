<h1>CRM/Booking System</h1>

<p>For this project, I created a web based CRM/Booking system for companies operating in the pet care industry -- specifically dog daycare companies.</p>

<p>This project was undertaken to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>learn Flask and associated technologies. Frontend work with Jinja2, JavaScript, HTML and CSS naturally followed.</li>
  <li>solve a problem: lack of relevant options for CRM and booking systems for companies operating in this sector.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's safe to say that some of the code is not as elegant as I would have liked, and if I were to start again it would be much more clean. Some of the .py files are far too large and there is repetition of code for a number of views/routes which I would ideally clean up.</p>

<h2>Comments and docs</h2>

Unfortunately, the project lacks any documentation or consistent commenting. 

I worked on this project alone, and felt no need to comment or document the progress of the project further than descriptions on commits or occassional comments to track my thought process.

In more recent small projects, and through creating resources for students, I have made sure to comment much more clearly and consistently.

**I took a lot from working through this project, and there are many improvements I would make and best practices I would follow more closely were I to start again**
